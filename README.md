information retrieval (IR)


### Very ealy papers for CIS
- [Cases, scripts, and information-seeking strategies: On the design of interactive information retrieval systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095741749500011W). 
  - Nicholas J Belkin, Colleen Cool, Adelheit Stein, and Ulrich Thiel
  - ***Expert systems with applications, 1995***. 
  - Propose an interactive IR system using script-based information-seeking dialogues.
- [I3R: A new approach to the design of document retrieval systems](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(198711)38:6%3C389::AID-ASI1%3E3.0.CO;2-4). 
  - W Bruce Croft and Roger H Thompson
  - ***Journal of the american society for information science, 1987***
  - Introduce an intelligent intermediary for IR.
- [Information retrieval through man‐machine dialogue](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/eb026631/full/html). 
  - Robert N Oddy
  - ***Journal of documentation, 1977***
  - Propose the concept of IR through man-machine dialog.


### User study
- [Exploring conversational search with humans, assistants, and wizards](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3027063.3053175). 
  - Alexandra Vtyurina, Denis Savenkov, Eugene Agichtein, and Charles LA Clarke
  - ***Expert systems with applications, 1995***. 
  - Study how users behave when interacting with a human expert, a commercial intelligent assistant, and a human disguised as an automatic system. Concretely, authors ask 21 participants to solve 3 information seeking tasks by conversing with three agents: an existing commercial system, a human expert, and a perceived experimental automatic system, backed by a human “wizard behind the curtain.” They conclude that people do not have biases against CIS systems, as long as their performance is acceptable.



### Asking Clarifying Question
- [Exploratory Search: Beyond the Query-Response Paradigm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6812556). 
  - Ryen W. White and Resa A. Roth
  - ***Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services, 2009***. 
  - Their goal is not always to find the relevant passages for the user questions but also non-relevant passages that contain related topics in order to do clarification or recommendation sometimes 
- [Learning to ask good questions: Ranking clarification questions using neural expected value of perfect information](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1255/). 
  - Ryen W. White and Resa A. Roth
  - ***Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL, long paper), 2018***. 
  - Collect a clarifying question dataset from the posts in StackOverﬂow and proposed to select clarification questions based on the expected value of perfect information considering the usefulness of potential answers to a candidate question.
