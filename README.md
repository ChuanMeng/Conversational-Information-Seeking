### User study
- [Exploring conversational search with humans, assistants, and wizards](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095741749500011W). 
  - Alexandra Vtyurina, Denis Savenkov, Eugene Agichtein, and Charles LA Clarke
  - ***Expert systems with applications, 1995***. 
  - Study how users behave when interacting with a human expert, a commercial intelligent assistant, and a human disguised as an automatic system. Concretely, authors ask 21 participants to solve 3 information seeking tasks by conversing with three agents: an existing commercial system, a human expert, and a perceived experimental automatic system, backed by a human “wizard behind the curtain.” They conclude that people do not have biases against CIS systems, as long as their performance is acceptable.
